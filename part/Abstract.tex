        \begin{itemize}
            \item Our results show that a response system based on
            enhanced test- ing and contacttracing can have a majorrole
            in relaxing social-distancing intervention
            in the absence of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2\cite{aleta2020modelling}
        \end{itemize}
